# Understanding HTML Tag Matching with Regex

This tutorial aims to explain the function of a specific regular expression used for matching HTML tags. We will break down each part of the expression and describe what it does, helping you understand how regex works for this common use case.

# Summary

We will be describing the following regex for matching an HTML tag:

/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

This regex checks if a given string contains an HTML tag, capturing the tag name and attributes if any.

Anchors
In the given regex, there are no anchors used. The regex will search for an HTML tag anywhere within the input string.

# Quantifiers
There are several quantifiers in this regex:

(\/?): This matches an optional forward slash / at the beginning of the tag, indicating whether the tag is an opening or closing tag.
(\w+): This matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores), capturing the tag name.
((?:\s+\w+(?:\s*=\s*(?:".*?"|'.*?'|[^'">\s]+))?)*\s*): This complex expression matches zero or more attribute pairs (attribute name and value), including whitespace between them.
(\/?): This matches an optional forward slash / before the closing angle bracket >, indicating whether the tag is a self-closing tag.
OR Operator
The OR operator | is used within the attribute value matching section:

".*?": This matches a double-quoted attribute value.
'.*?': This matches a single-quoted attribute value.
[^'">\s]+: This matches an unquoted attribute value, which can't contain quotes, angle brackets, or whitespace.

# Character Classes
\w+: This character class matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores), used for capturing the tag name and attribute names.

# Flags
In the given regex, there are no flags used.
